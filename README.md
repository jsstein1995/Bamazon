# Bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront created using MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

To use this app, clone down the repository and install and require node inquirer and mySQL as dependencies: 



Run the app by typing "node bamazonCustomer.js" in the command line. 

You will then be presented with all the items in the inventory and prompted to select the id of the item you would like to purchase. If the item and its quantity is in stock, your bid will be placed and you will see the items price.
